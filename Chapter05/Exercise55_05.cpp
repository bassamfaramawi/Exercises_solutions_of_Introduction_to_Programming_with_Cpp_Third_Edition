/*
 **5.55 (Math tutor) Write a program that displays a menu as shown in the sample 
run. You can enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 for choosing an addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, or division test. After a test is finished, the menu is 
redisplayed. You may choose another test or enter 5 to exit the system. Each 
test generates two random singledigit numbers to form a question for addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, or division.
For a subtraction such as number1 â€“ number2, number1 is greater than
or equal to number2. For a division question such as number1 / number2,
number2 is not zero.
