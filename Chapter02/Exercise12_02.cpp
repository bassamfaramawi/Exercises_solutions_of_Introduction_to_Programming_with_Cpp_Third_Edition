/*
 * 2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and 
   take-off speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an 
   airplane to take off using the following formula:
        length = v2 / 2a
   Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and 
   the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum 
   runway length
